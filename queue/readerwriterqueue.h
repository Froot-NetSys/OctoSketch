// A lock-free queue for a single-consumer, single-producer architecture.
// The queue is also wait-free in the common path (except if more memory
// needs to be allocated, in which case malloc is called).
// Allocates memory sparingly, and only once if the original maximum size
// estimate is never exceeded.
// Tested on x86/x64 processors, but semantics should be correct for all
// architectures (given the right implementations in atomicops.h), provided
// that aligned integer and pointer accesses are naturally atomic.
// Note that there should only be one consumer thread and producer thread;
// Switching roles of the threads, or using multiple consecutive threads for
// one role, is not safe unless properly synchronized.
// Using the queue exclusively from one thread is fine, though a bit silly.

    // Design: Based on a queue-of-queues. The low-level queues are just
    // circular buffers with front and tail indices indicating where the
    // next element to dequeue is and where the next element can be enqueued,
    // respectively. Each low-level queue is called a "block". Each block
    // wastes exactly one element's worth of space to keep the design simple
    // (if front == tail then the queue is empty, and can't be full).
    // The high-level queue is a circular linked list of blocks; again there
    // is a front and tail, but this time they are pointers to the blocks.
    // The front block is where the next element to be dequeued is, provided
    // the block is not empty. The back block is where elements are to be
    // enqueued, provided the block is not full.
    // The producer thread owns all the tail indices/pointers. The consumer
    // thread owns all the front indices/pointers. Both threads read each
    // other's variables, but only the owning thread updates them. E.g. After
    // the consumer reads the producer's tail, the tail may change before the
    // consumer is done dequeuing an object, but the consumer knows the tail
    // will never go backwards, only forwards.
    // If there is no room to enqueue an object, an additional block (of
    // equal size to the last block) is added. Blocks are never removed.
